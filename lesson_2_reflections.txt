What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  When you initialise a repository, it creates a .git directory and setups git to use.  You need to do this so you can use git locally to start to store and version control files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area offers you a space to hold files, and to review before you commit them to the Git repository.
